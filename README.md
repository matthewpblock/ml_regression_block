# Running Jupyter with the `ml_regression_block` Environment

This project uses a dedicated virtual environment (`.venv`) called **ml_regression_block**.  
VS Code’s kernel detection can sometimes fail, so the recommended workflow is to run Jupyter manually and connect to it.

---

## 1. Activate the virtual environment
Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd c:\Projects\MS_Data_Analytics\Applied-Machine-Learning\ml_regression_block
.\.venv\Scripts\activate

## 2. Start Jupyter Notebook
1. `python -m notebook`  
2. Click the link generated in the terminal
3. Use the notebook in the web browser
