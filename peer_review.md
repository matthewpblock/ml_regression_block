# Peer Review of Adrianna Webb's Final Projection
[Adrianna Webb's Regression Analysis](https://github.com/AdriannaWebb/ml-regression-webb/blob/main/ml_regression_webb.ipynb)  

## Instructions: 
Submit a short peer review document in your own repository titled peer_review.md.
The peer review must contain a clickable Markdown link to the notebook (.ipynb) file reviewed along with your personal, well-organized and presented 4-pont review. Provide specifics - both positive and constructive feedback. Suggest improvements where possible and explain why a different choice might be useful as well. Focus on actionable suggestions that the author could realistically implement.

## Clarity & Organization (Is the notebook structured and easy to follow?)
I thought Adrianna did a great job deliberately following the assignment workflow and organizing her notebook in alignment with it. That made the notebook easly to follow.

## Feature Selection & Justification (Do the chosen features make sense given the objectives?)
I like that she applied some domain knowledge to the feature selection, picking features that are commonly known to be purchasing considerations. The engineered features also align with this approach (TotalSF, TotalBath, HouseAge, and RemodAge).

## Model Performance & Comparisons (Are the results and comparisons clearly explained?)
I liked the simple column graph layout for the comparison of model results. It made it easy to quickly see how the models compared in testing. 

## Reflection Quality (Are insights well thought out?)
Where Adrianna's explanations really excelled was in her analysis of what was going on in the results, especially in analyzing coefficient findings and explaining why some of the counterintuitive finds might actually make sense.  
Reading her "What did you learn" section also helped re-enforce lessons for me to takeaway, so I'm glad I read her notebook all the way through!
